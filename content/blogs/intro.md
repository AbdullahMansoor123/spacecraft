## About Me

As a **Computer Vision Engineer**, I harness advanced deep learning and image‐processing techniques to build AI-powered visual inspection systems that drive manufacturing quality and efficiency. My work bridges cutting-edge research with the rugged demands of the factory floor, delivering robust, deployable solutions that deliver clear ROI.

### Core Competencies
- **Surface Anomaly Detection**  
  Leverage convolutional neural networks and unsupervised learning to identify defects on complex textures in real time.

- **Real-Time Conveyor-Belt Inspection**  
  Design and deploy low-latency vision pipelines for high-speed production lines, ensuring zero downtime and maximal throughput.

- **OCR in Harsh Environments**  
  Implement resilient optical character recognition systems that read serial numbers and labels under challenging lighting and motion.

- **Unsupervised Defect Discovery**  
  Develop autoencoder-based and clustering approaches to uncover unknown defect classes without labeled examples.

### What I Deliver
- **Reliable Deployments**: End-to-end solutions ready for industrial integration, from data collection to model monitoring.  
- **Scalable Architectures**: Modular vision microservices that scale horizontally across multiple production cells.  
- **ROI-Driven Results**: Metrics-first approach—quantifying improvements in defect detection accuracy and throughput to demonstrate tangible value.
